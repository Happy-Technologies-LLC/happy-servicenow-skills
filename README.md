## What Are Platform Skills?

**Skills are packaged instructions that teach AI agents how to perform specific tasks on enterprise platforms.** Unlike MCP tools (which provide *capabilities*), skills provide *knowledge* — the procedures, best practices, and decision logic that make AI agents effective.

```
MCP = The kitchen and ingredients
Skills = The recipes
```

Current coverage focuses on the **ServiceNow®** platform, with 180+ skills across 23 categories covering ITSM, CSM, HRSD, SecOps, GRC, development, administration, and more.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install happy-platform-skills

# skills.sh
npx skills add Happy-Technologies-LLC/happy-platform-skills --all --full-depth
```

### Usage with Claude Code

```bash
# List available skills
npx hps list

# Search for skills
npx hps search "incident"

# Load a skill into your session
npx hps load itsm/incident-triage
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
import { SkillLoader, SkillRegistry } from 'happy-platform-skills';

// Load all skills
const registry = new SkillRegistry();
await registry.discover();

// Find skills by tag
const itsmSkills = registry.findByTag('itsm');

// Load a specific skill
const skill = await SkillLoader.load('itsm/incident-triage');
console.log(skill.instructions);
```
