# Case Summarization for Approvals

## Overview

This skill generates approval-focused summaries for HR cases, service requests, and requested items. It provides approvers with the context they need to make informed decisions:

- Extracting and highlighting business justification from request details and variables
- Calculating cost impact including recurring costs, one-time charges, and budget implications
- Building approval history timelines showing who approved, rejected, or is pending
- Surfacing policy compliance status and any flagged exceptions
- Summarizing the requester's profile, department context, and prior similar requests
- Identifying risk factors that may warrant additional scrutiny

**When to use:** When approvers need concise, decision-ready summaries of pending approvals, or when building automated approval notification enrichment for HR and IT requests.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `approver_user`, `sn_hr_core.case_reader`, `itil`, or `admin`
- **Plugins:** `com.sn_hr_service_delivery` (HR Service Delivery), `com.glideapp.servicecatalog` (Service Catalog)
- **Access:** Read access to `sysapproval_approver`, `sn_hr_core_case`, `sc_req_item`, `sc_request`, `sn_hr_core_profile`
- **Knowledge:** Approval process concepts, HR case lifecycle, catalog request variables

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve the Pending Approval Record

Fetch the approval record to identify the source document and approval context.

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sysapproval_approver
  query: approver=<user_sys_id>^state=requested^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,sysapproval,source_table,state,approver,group,sys_created_on,due_date,expected_start,comments
  limit: 20
```

**REST Approach:**
```
GET /api/now/table/sysapproval_approver
  ?sysparm_query=approver=<user_sys_id>^state=requested^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  &sysparm_fields=sys_id,sysapproval,source_table,state,approver,group,sys_created_on,due_date,comments
  &sysparm_display_value=true
  &sysparm_limit=20
```

### Step 2: Retrieve the Source Record Details

Based on the `source_table`, fetch the underlying request or case.

**For HR Cases:**

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_case
  sys_id: <sysapproval_value>
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,opened_by,opened_at,subject_person,hr_service,assignment_group,u_business_justification,u_cost_estimate
```

**For Requested Items (sc_req_item):**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sc_req_item
  sys_id: <sysapproval_value>
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,cat_item,requested_for,price,recurring_price,quantity,variables,opened_at,opened_by,request,stage
```

**REST Approach:**
```
GET /api/now/table/sc_req_item/<sysapproval_value>
  ?sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,description,cat_item,requested_for,price,recurring_price,quantity
  &sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Extract Business Justification

Pull justification from multiple sources: request variables, description fields, and journal entries.

**From Catalog Variables:**

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sc_item_option_mtom
  query: request_item=<ritm_sys_id>
  fields: sc_item_option.item_option_new.question_text,sc_item_option.value
  limit: 50
```

**From Journal/Comments:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=<source_sys_id>^element=comments^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 20
```

### Step 4: Calculate Cost Impact

Aggregate costs from the request including one-time and recurring charges.

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sc_req_item
  query: request=<request_sys_id>
  fields: sys_id,number,cat_item,price,recurring_price,quantity
  limit: 50
```

For detailed pricing:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: fx_price
  query: id=<cat_item_sys_id>^active=true
  fields: sys_id,amount,currency,type,recurring_frequency,duration
  limit: 5
```

Calculate totals:
- **One-time cost**: SUM(price * quantity) across all line items
- **Monthly recurring**: SUM(recurring_price * quantity)
- **Annual impact**: One-time + (Monthly recurring * 12)
- **Budget utilization**: Compare against department budget if available

### Step 5: Build Approval History

Retrieve the full approval chain including completed and pending approvals.

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sysapproval_approver
  query: sysapproval=<source_sys_id>^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,approver,state,sys_created_on,sys_updated_on,comments,group,expected_start,due_date
  limit: 20
```

**REST Approach:**
```
GET /api/now/table/sysapproval_approver
  ?sysparm_query=sysapproval=<source_sys_id>^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  &sysparm_fields=sys_id,approver,state,sys_created_on,sys_updated_on,comments,group
  &sysparm_display_value=true
  &sysparm_limit=20
```

### Step 6: Retrieve Requester Profile Context

Get the requester's HR profile and department information for context.

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_profile
  query: user=<opened_by_sys_id>
  fields: sys_id,user,department,location,job_title,manager,cost_center,employment_type,hire_date
  limit: 1
```

### Step 7: Check for Prior Similar Requests

Identify if the requester or department has submitted similar requests recently.

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sc_req_item
  query: requested_for=<requester_sys_id>^cat_item=<cat_item_sys_id>^sys_created_on>javascript:gs.daysAgo(365)
  fields: number,stage,price,sys_created_on,closed_at
  limit: 10
```

### Step 8: Assess Policy Compliance

Check if the request falls within policy thresholds:

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sysapproval_rule
  query: table=sc_req_item^active=true
  fields: sys_id,name,description,condition,approval_type,order
  limit: 10
```

### Step 9: Compile the Approval Summary

Assemble all gathered information into a decision-ready format:

```

**MCP Approach:**
```
Tool: SN-Add-Work-Notes
Parameters:
  table_name: sysapproval_approver
  sys_id: <approval_sys_id>
  work_notes: "[AI-Generated Approval Summary]\n<compiled summary>"
```

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| SN-Query-Table | Fetch approvals, requests, profiles, history | Primary data gathering |
| SN-Get-Record | Retrieve single source record details | Detailed record inspection |
| SN-Natural-Language-Search | Find related requests or cases by description | Pattern matching for similar items |
| SN-Add-Work-Notes | Attach summary to approval record | Documentation and audit trail |

## Best Practices

1. **Lead with the decision-critical information** -- cost, justification, and risk at the top
2. **Include approval chain context** -- show what others have already decided
3. **Flag exceptions clearly** -- highlight policy violations or unusual patterns
4. **Show budget impact as percentage** -- raw numbers lack context without budget reference
5. **Include requester tenure** -- new hire requests may have different approval considerations
6. **Check for duplicate requests** -- surface recent similar requests to prevent waste
7. **Respect data sensitivity** -- omit salary, medical, or disciplinary details from summaries
8. **Use display values** -- always show names and labels rather than sys_ids
9. **Include timeline urgency** -- note SLA deadlines for time-sensitive approvals
10. **Provide historical benchmarks** -- show how similar requests were handled

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| No approval records found | User has no pending approvals or wrong user sys_id | Verify approver sys_id matches the logged-in user |
| Variables not returned | MTOM query format incorrect | Use `sc_item_option_mtom` with proper dot-walking |
| Cost data missing | Catalog item has no price configured | Check `sc_cat_item.price` and `fx_price` table |
| Approval history incomplete | Some approvals use group instead of individual | Include `group` field and resolve group members |
| Journal entries empty | Comments stored in different element | Check both `comments` and `work_notes` elements |
| Profile not found | User lacks HR profile record | Fall back to `sys_user` table for basic information |

## Examples

### Example 1: HR Case Approval Summary

**Input:** "Summarize HR case HRC0010042 for the approver"

**Steps:** Retrieve case from `sn_hr_core_case`, pull employee profile, check approval chain, extract justification from case description and comments, calculate any cost impact from associated catalog items, compile summary.

### Example 2: High-Value Request Approval

**Input:** "Generate an approval summary for RITM0025001 which is a $15,000 server request"

**Steps:** Retrieve RITM details, extract all catalog variables including configuration specs, pull pricing details, build full approval chain (may include multiple levels for high-value items), check against procurement policies, flag budget impact, include vendor quotes if attached.

### Example 3: Batch Approval Summary for Manager

**Input:** "Show me all pending approvals with summaries for manager Bob Johnson"

**Steps:** Query all `sysapproval_approver` records where approver is Bob Johnson and state is requested, for each retrieve source record summary, aggregate total cost impact across all pending items, present as a prioritized list sorted by due date.
