# Resume Skill Extraction

## Overview

This skill extracts structured skill, qualification, and experience data from resume information stored in ServiceNow's talent management modules. It helps you:

- Parse and extract skills, certifications, and qualifications from candidate records
- Map extracted skills to organizational competency frameworks
- Compare candidate qualifications against job requisition requirements
- Identify skill gaps and strengths relative to target positions
- Populate talent profile records with structured skill data
- Support bulk extraction for talent pipeline analysis

**When to use:** When recruiters or HR talent teams need to systematically extract and categorize skills from candidate applications, match candidates to open requisitions, or build competency profiles for workforce planning.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_hr_tm.recruiter`, `sn_hr_tm.hiring_manager`, or `sn_hr_core.manager`
- **Plugins:** `com.sn_hr_service_delivery` (HR Service Delivery), `com.sn_hr_talent_management` (Talent Management)
- **Access:** Read/write access to `sn_hr_tm_candidate`, `sn_hr_tm_skill`, `sn_hr_tm_competency`, and `sn_hr_tm_job_requisition`
- **Knowledge:** Understanding of your organization's competency framework and job family structure

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve Candidate Record

Fetch the candidate profile that contains resume data and application details.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_tm_candidate
  query: number=[candidate_number]
  fields: sys_id,number,first_name,last_name,email,phone,source,stage,resume_text,resume_content,current_title,current_employer,years_experience,education_level,location,skills_summary
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_candidate?sysparm_query=number=[candidate_number]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,first_name,last_name,email,phone,source,stage,resume_text,resume_content,current_title,current_employer,years_experience,education_level,location,skills_summary&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=1
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Resume Attachment

If the resume is stored as an attachment rather than in a text field, fetch the attachment metadata.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_attachment
  query: table_name=sn_hr_tm_candidate^table_sys_id=[candidate_sys_id]^content_typeLIKEpdf^ORcontent_typeLIKEdoc^ORcontent_typeLIKEtext
  fields: sys_id,file_name,content_type,size_bytes,sys_created_on
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_attachment?sysparm_query=table_name=sn_hr_tm_candidate^table_sys_id=[candidate_sys_id]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,file_name,content_type,size_bytes,sys_created_on&sysparm_limit=5

# Download attachment content:
GET /api/now/attachment/{attachment_sys_id}/file
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Target Job Requisition

Fetch the job requisition to understand required skills and qualifications for comparison.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_tm_job_requisition
  query: number=[requisition_number]
  fields: sys_id,number,title,description,department,location,job_family,required_skills,preferred_skills,minimum_education,minimum_experience,competencies,status,hiring_manager
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_job_requisition?sysparm_query=number=[requisition_number]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,title,description,department,location,job_family,required_skills,preferred_skills,minimum_education,minimum_experience,competencies,status,hiring_manager&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=1
```

### Step 4: Fetch Organizational Competency Framework

Retrieve the competency definitions that skills should be mapped to.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_tm_competency
  query: active=true^job_familyLIKE[target_job_family]
  fields: sys_id,name,description,category,proficiency_levels,job_family,required_level,active
  limit: 50
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_competency?sysparm_query=active=true^job_familyLIKEEngineering&sysparm_fields=sys_id,name,description,category,proficiency_levels,job_family,required_level&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=50
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Existing Skill Taxonomy

Pull the organization's skill taxonomy to map extracted skills to standardized entries.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_tm_skill
  query: active=true
  fields: sys_id,name,category,skill_type,description,active
  limit: 200
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_skill?sysparm_query=active=true&sysparm_fields=sys_id,name,category,skill_type,description&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=200
```

### Step 6: Extract and Categorize Skills from Resume

Parse the resume text and categorize extracted information:

  table_name: sn_hr_tm_candidate
  sys_id: [candidate_sys_id]
  data:
    skills_summary: "Kubernetes(Expert), AWS(Expert), Terraform(Advanced), Python(Advanced), Docker(Expert), CI/CD(Expert), Ansible(Intermediate)"
    education_level: "Masters"
    years_experience: 8
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
PATCH /api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_candidate/[candidate_sys_id]
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "skills_summary": "Kubernetes(Expert), AWS(Expert), Terraform(Advanced), Python(Advanced), Docker(Expert), CI/CD(Expert), Ansible(Intermediate)",
  "education_level": "Masters",
  "years_experience": 8
}
```

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Query-Table` | Query candidates, requisitions, skills taxonomy, competencies |
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Natural language search for matching candidates or roles |
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve full candidate record with resume content |
| `SN-Update-Record` | Write extracted skill data back to candidate profiles |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_candidate` | GET/PATCH | Candidate records and resume data |
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_job_requisition` | GET | Job requisition requirements |
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_skill` | GET | Organizational skill taxonomy |
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_competency` | GET | Competency framework definitions |
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_tm_qualification` | GET | Certification and qualification records |
| `/api/now/table/sys_attachment` | GET | Resume file attachments |

## Best Practices

- **Normalize skill names:** Map variations (e.g., "k8s", "Kube", "Kubernetes") to the single canonical taxonomy entry
- **Preserve original text:** Keep the raw extracted text alongside normalized mappings for audit purposes
- **Handle multi-format resumes:** Support PDF, DOCX, and plain text; extraction quality varies by format
- **Validate certifications:** Cross-reference certification claims with known certification bodies and expiry dates
- **Use proficiency indicators:** Infer proficiency from context (years of use, project complexity, leadership role) rather than self-reported levels alone
- **Respect data privacy:** Resume data is PII; limit extraction results to authorized recruiting personnel
- **Update taxonomy regularly:** Flag unmapped skills for taxonomy administrators to review and potentially add

## Troubleshooting

### "Resume text field is empty"

**Cause:** Resume may be stored only as an attachment, not parsed into the text field
**Solution:** Query `sys_attachment` for the candidate record and download the file content via the attachment API

### "No matching skills in taxonomy"

**Cause:** Organization's skill taxonomy may not cover all technical domains
**Solution:** Record unmapped skills separately and flag them for taxonomy expansion; do not discard unmatched skills

### "Candidate application not linked to requisition"

**Cause:** The application record may use a different reference field
**Solution:** Query `sn_hr_tm_candidate_application` with `candidate=[candidate_sys_id]` to find the linking record and requisition reference

### "Competency framework returns empty"

**Cause:** Competencies may not be tagged by job family or may use a different categorization
**Solution:** Query without the `job_family` filter and manually match competencies based on description and category

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Candidate Screening

**Input:** "Extract skills from candidate CND0004521 for requisition REQ0002345"

**Steps:**
1. Query `sn_hr_tm_candidate` for resume data
2. Query `sn_hr_tm_job_requisition` for requirements
3. Fetch skill taxonomy from `sn_hr_tm_skill`
4. Extract and categorize skills from resume text
5. Run gap analysis against requisition
6. Update candidate record with structured data

### Example 2: Bulk Pipeline Analysis

**Input:** "Extract skills from all candidates applying to Engineering requisitions"

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_tm_candidate_application
  query: job_requisition.departmentLIKEEngineering^status=active
  fields: sys_id,candidate,job_requisition,status,applied_date,stage
  limit: 50
```

Then iterate through each candidate to extract and compare skills.

### Example 3: Internal Mobility Skill Assessment

**Input:** "Assess current employee's skills for an internal transfer"

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_profile
  query: user=[employee_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,user,department,job_title,skills,certifications,education,years_in_role
  limit: 1
```

Compare the employee's existing profile skills against the target role requirements using the same gap analysis framework.
