# Persona-Based HR Assistant

## Overview

This skill provides personalized HR assistance by adapting responses and service routing based on the employee's role, department, location, tenure, and interaction history. It helps you:

- Identify the employee persona (new hire, manager, executive, remote worker, contractor, etc.)
- Surface role-specific HR services, policies, and self-service options
- Route inquiries to the correct Center of Excellence (COE) based on persona and topic
- Provide location-aware and department-aware policy guidance
- Leverage case history to anticipate needs and avoid redundant information
- Deliver personalized onboarding, benefits, and career development guidance

**When to use:** When an HR agent or virtual agent needs to provide tailored HR assistance that accounts for the employee's full context, or when designing persona-driven service catalog experiences.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_hr_core.case_writer`, `sn_hr_core.agent`, or `sn_hr_core.manager`
- **Plugins:** `com.sn_hr_service_delivery` (HR Service Delivery), `com.sn_hr_service_portal` (HR Service Portal, optional)
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_hr_core_profile`, `sn_hr_core_case`, `sn_hr_le_case_type`, `sn_hr_core_service`, `kb_knowledge`, and `cmn_department`
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with your organization's HR service catalog, COE structure, and location-specific policy variations

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Employee and Build Profile Context

Retrieve the full employee HR profile to determine persona attributes.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_profile
  query: user=[employee_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,user,department,location,employment_type,hire_date,manager,job_title,cost_center,building,employee_type,benefits_eligible,pay_group,schedule,work_schedule,vip
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_hr_core_profile?sysparm_query=user=[employee_sys_id]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,user,department,location,employment_type,hire_date,manager,job_title,cost_center,building,employee_type,benefits_eligible,pay_group,schedule,work_schedule,vip&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=1
```

### Step 2: Retrieve User Details and Organizational Context

```

### Step 5: Retrieve Available HR Services for Persona

Fetch HR services applicable to the employee's persona and eligibility.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_service
  query: active=true^ORDERBYorder
  fields: sys_id,name,description,category,hr_service_center,active,employee_visible,order

```

### Step 6: Check Interaction History and Open Cases

Review the employee's recent HR interactions to provide continuity-aware assistance.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_case
  query: subject_person=[employee_sys_id]^active=true^ORDERBYDESCopened_at
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,hr_service,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,priority

```

### Step 8: Generate Personalized Assistance Response

Compose a persona-aware response with relevant services, policies, and routing:

```
=== PERSONALIZED HR ASSISTANCE ===

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Create-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_hr_core_case
  data:
    subject_person: [employee_sys_id]
    short_description: [inquiry_summary]

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_hr_core_profile` | GET | Employee HR profile and persona attributes |
| `/api/now/table/sys_user` | GET | User account details |
| `/api/now/table/cmn_department` | GET | Department hierarchy context |

## Best Practices

- **Cache persona classification:** Store the persona determination so it does not need to be recalculated on every interaction within the same session
- **Layer personas:** Employees often fit multiple personas (e.g., Manager + Remote Worker); combine relevant services from all applicable personas
- **Prioritize active cases:** Always surface open cases first so employees can check status before creating duplicates
- **Use location hierarchy:** When location-specific policies are not found, fall back to state, then country, then global policies
- **Respect VIP handling:** Employees flagged as VIP should receive expedited routing and white-glove service options
- **Adapt language:** Match the communication style to the persona (executives prefer concise summaries; new hires need more guidance)
- **Track persona effectiveness:** Monitor which persona-driven suggestions lead to case creation vs. self-service resolution to refine persona rules
- **Handle contractors carefully:** Contractors have different benefits eligibility, policy access, and service entitlements; always check `employment_type`

## Troubleshooting

### "Employee profile not found"

**Cause:** New hires or contingent workers may not have HR profiles created yet
**Solution:** Fall back to `sys_user` for basic details. Create a minimal persona from user record fields (department, location, title)

### "COE routing returns multiple matches"

**Cause:** Some inquiry topics span multiple COEs (e.g., relocation involves Benefits + Workplace)
**Solution:** Use the primary topic to select the lead COE and note secondary COEs in the case description for collaboration

### "Location-specific policies not available"

**Cause:** KB articles may not be tagged with location metadata
**Solution:** Search by policy topic combined with location keywords in the article text. Check `sn_hr_sp_content` for portal content that may be location-filtered

### "Service catalog shows services employee is not eligible for"

**Cause:** Eligibility rules may be configured at the catalog item level, not in the service record
**Solution:** Check `sn_hr_le_case_type` for `employee_visible` and any associated user criteria records that restrict access
