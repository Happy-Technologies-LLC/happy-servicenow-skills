# Chat Reply Recommendation

## Overview

This skill provides a structured approach to generating recommended chat replies for ITSM agents handling live support conversations. It covers:

- Analyzing incident context to understand the user's issue and history
- Matching the issue against knowledge base articles for known solutions
- Reviewing resolution history of similar past incidents
- Generating context-aware reply suggestions with appropriate technical detail
- Adapting tone and complexity based on the user's technical proficiency
- Providing escalation and handoff messages when issues exceed agent scope

**When to use:** When live chat agents need assistance formulating accurate, helpful responses during support conversations, particularly for complex technical issues or when quick access to knowledge base content is needed.

**Plugin required:** `com.snc.incident` (Incident Management), optionally `com.glide.interaction` (Agent Workspace)

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `itil`, `sn_interaction_read`, or `agent_workspace_user`
- **Access:** Read access to `incident`, `kb_knowledge`, `problem`, `interaction`
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with common IT support scenarios, knowledge base structure, and chat etiquette
- **Plugins:** `com.snc.incident` must be activated; `com.glide.interaction` recommended for chat context

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve the Active Incident Context

Pull the incident associated with the chat session.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: incident
  sys_id: [incident_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,assignment_group,assigned_to,caller_id,caller_id.name,caller_id.vip,cmdb_ci,business_service,opened_at,work_notes_list
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/incident/[incident_sys_id]?sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,assignment_group,assigned_to,caller_id,cmdb_ci,business_service,opened_at&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 2: Review the Chat/Interaction History

Retrieve the conversation thread to understand what has already been discussed.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: interaction
  query: document=incident^document_id=[incident_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,type,direction,message,opened_for,assigned_to,state,channel,sys_created_on
  limit: 20
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/interaction?sysparm_query=document=incident^document_id=[incident_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=sys_id,type,direction,message,opened_for,assigned_to,state,channel,sys_created_on&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=20
```

### Step 3: Search Knowledge Base for Solutions

Find relevant knowledge articles matching the incident description.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  query: workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword1]^ORtextLIKE[keyword1]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,text,kb_category,workflow_state,rating
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/kb_knowledge?sysparm_query=workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword1]^ORtextLIKE[keyword1]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,text,kb_category&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=5
```

### Step 4: Find Similar Resolved Incidents

Look for past incidents with similar descriptions that have been resolved.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: incident
  query: state=6^ORstate=7^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword]^ORcategoryLIKE[category]^ORDERBYDESCresolved_at
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,close_code,close_notes,resolved_at,category
  limit: 10
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/incident?sysparm_query=state=6^ORstate=7^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword]^ORDERBYDESCresolved_at&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,close_code,close_notes,resolved_at,category&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=10
```

### Step 5: Check for Known Problems

Identify if the issue is linked to a known problem with a workaround.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: problem
  query: active=true^known_error=true^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,workaround,fix,state,known_error
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/problem?sysparm_query=active=true^known_error=true^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,workaround,fix,state,known_error&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=5
```

### Step 6: Generate Recommended Chat Replies

Based on the gathered context, generate appropriate reply options.

**Reply Templates by Scenario:**

**Scenario 1: Known Solution Found (KB Match)**
```

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve incident and user context |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Search interactions, KB articles, similar incidents, known errors |
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Natural language knowledge base search |
| `SN-Update-Record` | Update incident state or assignment during chat |
| `SN-Add-Work-Notes` | Document recommended replies and actions |
| `SN-Execute-Background-Script` | Complex matching logic or bulk recommendation analysis |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/incident` | GET | Query incident context |
| `/api/now/table/kb_knowledge` | GET | Search knowledge base |
| `/api/now/table/problem` | GET | Find known errors |
| `/api/now/table/interaction` | GET | Review chat history |
| `/api/now/table/sys_user` | GET | Check caller details and VIP status |

## Best Practices

- **Read Before Replying:** Always review the chat history to avoid asking questions already answered
- **Match Technical Level:** Adjust language complexity based on whether the user is technical or non-technical
- **Provide Options:** When multiple solutions exist, present the simplest first with alternatives
- **Set Expectations:** Always communicate estimated resolution time or next steps
- **Acknowledge VIPs:** Check the caller's VIP flag and adjust priority and tone accordingly
- **Link to KB Articles:** Reference specific KB articles so users can self-serve for future occurrences
- **Confirm Resolution:** Always ask the user to confirm the issue is resolved before closing

## Troubleshooting

### No Knowledge Base Matches

**Cause:** Search terms too specific or KB not populated for this topic
**Solution:** Broaden search terms. Try searching by category instead of exact description. Fall back to similar incident resolution patterns.

### Chat History Not Available

**Cause:** Interaction records not created, or chat happened through a different channel
**Solution:** Check `sys_journal_field` for comments on the incident. Review `sys_email` for email-based communication.

### Recommended Reply Too Technical

**Cause:** Reply generated from technical KB articles without simplification
**Solution:** Check the caller's role and department. Rewrite technical steps in plain language. Offer to walk through steps together.

### Escalation Target Unknown

**Cause:** Assignment group routing not clear for the specific issue type
**Solution:** Query `sys_user_group` for groups matching the incident category. Check the assignment lookup rules or use the standard escalation matrix.
