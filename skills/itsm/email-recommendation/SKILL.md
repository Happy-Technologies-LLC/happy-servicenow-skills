# ITSM Email Recommendation

## Overview

This skill provides a structured approach to generating professional email responses for IT service management cases. It covers:

- Analyzing incident, change, or problem context to craft targeted email responses
- Incorporating relevant technical details without overwhelming non-technical recipients
- Referencing knowledge base articles and known workarounds in responses
- Providing clear next steps and expected timelines for resolution
- Generating status update emails for ongoing incidents
- Creating closure notification emails with resolution summaries

**When to use:** When ITSM agents need to send professional, well-structured email responses to end users, stakeholders, or management regarding IT service cases. Particularly useful for complex incidents requiring technical explanation or status updates on high-priority issues.

**Plugin required:** `com.snc.incident` (Incident Management)

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `itil`, `incident_manager`, or `admin`
- **Access:** Read access to `incident`, `change_request`, `problem`, `kb_knowledge`, `sys_email`; write access to incident work notes
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with IT service management processes, SLA requirements, and organizational communication standards
- **Plugins:** `com.snc.incident` must be activated

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve the Case Context

Pull the full record to understand the issue, current state, and stakeholders.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: incident
  sys_id: [incident_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,impact,urgency,category,subcategory,assignment_group,assigned_to,caller_id,caller_id.name,caller_id.email,caller_id.vip,opened_at,resolved_at,close_code,close_notes,business_service,cmdb_ci,sla_due,made_sla
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/incident/[incident_sys_id]?sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,impact,urgency,category,subcategory,assignment_group,assigned_to,caller_id,opened_at,resolved_at,close_code,close_notes,business_service,cmdb_ci,sla_due,made_sla&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 2: Review Communication History

Check previous emails to maintain thread continuity and avoid redundancy.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_email
  query: instance=incident^target=[incident_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,type,subject,body_text,recipients,sys_created_on
  limit: 10
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_email?sysparm_query=instance=incident^target=[incident_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=sys_id,type,subject,body_text,recipients,sys_created_on&sysparm_display_value=true&sysparm_limit=10
```

### Step 3: Gather Technical Context

Review work notes for diagnostic findings and actions taken.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=[incident_sys_id]^name=incident^element=work_notes^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: value,sys_created_by,sys_created_on
  limit: 20
```

### Step 4: Find Relevant Knowledge Articles

Search for KB articles to reference in the email.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  query: workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE[keyword1]^ORtextLIKE[keyword1]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,text
  limit: 5
```

### Step 5: Check for Related Records

Identify related problems, changes, or known errors for context.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Execute-Background-Script
Parameters:
  description: Gather related records for email context
  script: |
    var incId = '[incident_sys_id]';
    var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
    inc.get(incId);

    gs.info('=== RELATED RECORDS FOR EMAIL CONTEXT ===');

    // Related problem
    if (inc.problem_id && inc.problem_id.toString() !== '') {
      var prob = inc.problem_id.getRefRecord();
      gs.info('Problem: ' + prob.number + ' | ' + prob.short_description + ' | Workaround: ' + prob.workaround);
    }

    // Related changes
    var change = new GlideRecord('change_request');
    change.addQuery('reason', incId);
    change.query();
    while (change.next()) {
      gs.info('Change: ' + change.number + ' | ' + change.short_description + ' | State: ' + change.state.getDisplayValue() + ' | Scheduled: ' + change.start_date);
    }

    // Similar recent incidents (for pattern context)
    var similar = new GlideRecord('incident');
    similar.addQuery('category', inc.category.toString());
    similar.addQuery('state', '6'); // Resolved
    similar.addQuery('sys_id', '!=', incId);
    similar.addQuery('sys_created_on', '>=', gs.daysAgo(30));
    similar.orderByDesc('resolved_at');
    similar.setLimit(5);
    similar.query();

    gs.info('\n--- Similar Resolved Incidents ---');
    while (similar.next()) {
      gs.info(similar.number + ': ' + similar.short_description + ' | Resolution: ' + similar.close_notes.toString().substring(0, 100));
    }
```

### Step 6: Generate the Email Response

Select the appropriate template based on the case state and compose the email.

**Template 1: Initial Acknowledgment**

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve full incident/change/problem context |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Query email history, work notes, related records |
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Find relevant knowledge articles for email references |
| `SN-Update-Record` | Update incident with email notification details |
| `SN-Add-Work-Notes` | Document the recommended email |
| `SN-Execute-Background-Script` | Gather cross-record context, bulk email generation |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/incident` | GET/PATCH | Read incident and update records |
| `/api/now/table/change_request` | GET | Find related changes for context |
| `/api/now/table/problem` | GET | Find related problems and workarounds |
| `/api/now/table/kb_knowledge` | GET | Search for relevant KB articles |
| `/api/now/table/sys_email` | GET | Review communication history |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Extract work notes for technical context |

## Best Practices

- **Plain Language:** Translate technical jargon into language the recipient can understand; save technical details for work notes
- **Be Specific:** Include incident numbers, dates, and concrete next steps rather than vague promises
- **Set Expectations:** Always communicate expected timelines and what the user can expect next
- **Reference Self-Service:** Point users to KB articles and the service portal for future self-resolution
- **Maintain Thread:** Use "Re:" prefix and include the incident number for email thread continuity
- **VIP Awareness:** Check the caller's VIP status and adjust tone and urgency language accordingly
- **Proofread for Tone:** Ensure the email conveys professionalism and empathy, especially for frustrated users

## Troubleshooting

### Email History Not Loading

**Cause:** Emails sent through external systems may not be logged in `sys_email`
**Solution:** Check `sys_journal_field` for comments that may contain email content. Review notification logs for delivery status.

### KB Articles Not Matching

**Cause:** Search terms too specific or KB articles categorized differently
**Solution:** Broaden search terms. Try category-based searching. Use `SN-Natural-Language-Search` for semantic matching.

### Email Template Not Fitting the Scenario

**Cause:** Incident state or context does not match standard templates
**Solution:** Combine elements from multiple templates. Customize based on the specific situation. Always include: current status, actions taken, and next steps.

### Recipient Unclear

**Cause:** Caller and affected user may be different people, or multiple stakeholders need updates
**Solution:** Check `caller_id`, `opened_by`, and `watch_list` fields. For major incidents, use the distribution list from the major incident process.
