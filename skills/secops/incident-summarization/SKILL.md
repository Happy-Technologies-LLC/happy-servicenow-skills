# Security Incident Summarization

## Overview

This skill enables SOC analysts and security managers to generate structured summaries of security incidents at multiple levels of detail. It produces both executive summaries for leadership and technical summaries for operational teams, ensuring consistent communication about incident status, impact, and response actions.

Key capabilities:
- Generate concise executive summaries suitable for CISO and management briefings
- Produce detailed technical summaries with IOCs, attack vectors, and forensic findings
- Classify threats using standardized categories and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Inventory affected assets with business criticality context
- Summarize containment status and response progress
- Compile recommended actions prioritized by urgency

**When to use:** When a security incident requires communication to stakeholders at any level, including management updates, cross-team coordination, regulatory notifications, or documentation for compliance.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_si.analyst`, `sn_si.manager`
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_si_incident`, `sn_si_task`, `sn_ti_observable`, `sn_vul_vulnerable_item`, `cmdb_ci`, `sys_journal_field` tables
- **Plugins:** Security Incident Response (sn_si), Threat Intelligence (sn_ti), Vulnerability Response (sn_vul)
- **Data:** An active or recently closed security incident with populated fields

## Procedure

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SN-Get-Record | Retrieve full incident details by sys_id |
| SN-Query-Table | Query tasks, observables, vulnerabilities, CIs, and work notes |
| SN-Add-Work-Notes | Post executive and technical summaries to the incident |
| SN-Natural-Language-Search | Natural language queries for quick incident lookup |

## Best Practices

- **Tailor the summary to the audience** with executive summaries focused on business impact and decisions, technical summaries focused on IOCs and response actions
- **Use consistent formatting** so recipients can quickly find the information they need across incidents
- **Include timestamps** on all summaries so readers know how current the information is
- **Highlight decisions needed** in executive summaries to drive action from leadership
- **List IOCs in a machine-parseable format** in technical summaries for easy ingestion into blocking tools
- **Reference MITRE ATT&CK** techniques to standardize threat classification across the organization
- **Update summaries regularly** during active incidents; stale summaries erode stakeholder confidence
- **Separate facts from assessments** clearly labeling confirmed findings vs. analyst judgment

## Troubleshooting

### CI Details Not Available
**Cause:** The `cmdb_ci` field on the incident may reference a CI that has been decommissioned or is in a different CMDB class.
**Solution:** Search `cmdb_ci_list` by name or IP address. Check the `cmdb_ci_server`, `cmdb_ci_computer`, or other subclass tables.

### No Observables Linked to Incident
**Cause:** Threat intelligence may not have been ingested or linked to the specific incident.
**Solution:** Check the `sn_ti_observable` table broadly for relevant IOCs by value. Manually link observables to the incident if found.

### Task Types Not Matching Expected Workflow
**Cause:** Different playbook configurations may use different task types or naming conventions.
**Solution:** Query `sn_si_task` without task_type filter to see all tasks. Review the playbook configuration for the incident category.

## Examples

**Example 1: P1 Incident Executive Briefing**
1. Retrieve incident SIR0009100 with full classification details
2. Query CMDB for affected server details and business criticality
3. Pull 6 observables including 2 IPs, 2 hashes, 1 domain, 1 email
4. Identify 8 response tasks, 5 complete and 3 in progress
5. Generate executive summary highlighting $50K/day business impact
6. Post summary to incident and email to CISO distribution list

**Example 2: Multi-Asset Incident Technical Summary**
1. Retrieve incident SIR0008750 affecting 15 workstations and 2 servers
2. Query CMDB for all 17 affected CIs with IP addresses and OS versions
3. Collect 23 IOCs across IP, domain, hash, and registry key types
4. Map attack to 7 MITRE ATT&CK techniques across 4 tactics
5. Document containment status per asset in tabular format
6. Generate both executive and technical summaries in a single update
