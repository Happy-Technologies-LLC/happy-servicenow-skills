# Email Recommendation

## Overview

This skill generates professional, contextually appropriate email response drafts for Customer Service Management (CSM) cases. It helps you:

- Analyze the full case context, including issue description, category, priority, and current state
- Review the email communication history to maintain conversation continuity
- Search the knowledge base for relevant solutions and reference materials
- Assess customer sentiment from previous communications to calibrate tone
- Generate templated or custom email drafts with appropriate structure, empathy, and resolution content
- Provide multiple response variations for different scenarios (acknowledgment, update, resolution, escalation)

**When to use:** When a CSM agent needs to compose a professional email response to a customer inquiry, provide a status update, share a resolution, or handle an escalation via email.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_customerservice_agent`, `sn_customerservice_manager`, or `csm_admin`
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_customerservice_case`, `sys_email`, `kb_knowledge`, `sys_journal_field`, `customer_account`, `customer_contact`, and `sn_customerservice_sla` tables
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with your organization's email communication guidelines, branding standards, and CSM workflows
- **Configuration:** Email notifications and templates should be configured in CSM; outbound email enabled

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve Case Details and Current State

Fetch the full case record to understand what the customer is contacting about.

**Using MCP (Claude Code/Desktop):**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  sys_id: [case_sys_id]
  fields: number,short_description,description,state,priority,urgency,impact,category,subcategory,contact,account,consumer,product,asset,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,opened_by,resolved_at,resolution_code,resolution_notes,escalation,severity,sla_due,contact_type,reassignment_count,reopen_count
```

If searching by case number:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: number=CS0012345
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,contact,account,consumer,product,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,resolution_code,resolution_notes,escalation,sla_due
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case?sysparm_query=number=CS0012345&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,contact,account,consumer,product,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,resolution_code,resolution_notes,escalation,sla_due&sysparm_limit=1&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 2: Review Email Communication History

Retrieve all previous emails on this case to understand the conversation thread and avoid repeating information.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_email
  query: instance=<case_sys_id>^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,subject,type,recipients,sys_created_on,sys_created_by,body_text,direct,importance,content_type
  limit: 20
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_email?sysparm_query=instance=<case_sys_id>^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=sys_id,subject,type,recipients,sys_created_on,sys_created_by,body_text,direct,importance&sysparm_limit=20&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Get Customer and Account Information

Retrieve the contact and account details for personalization and tone calibration.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: customer_contact
  query: sys_id=[contact_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,name,first_name,last_name,email,phone,title,account,preferred_contact_method,timezone
  limit: 1
```

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: customer_account
  query: sys_id=[account_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,name,customer_tier,industry,account_code,notes
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/customer_contact/{contact_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=name,first_name,last_name,email,phone,title,preferred_contact_method,timezone&sysparm_display_value=true

GET /api/now/table/customer_account/{account_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=name,customer_tier,industry,account_code&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 4: Check SLA Status

Determine SLA compliance to decide urgency and tone of the response.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_sla
  query: task=<case_sys_id>^stage!=cancelled
  fields: sys_id,sla,stage,has_breached,planned_end_time,percentage,pause_duration,business_percentage
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_sla?sysparm_query=task=<case_sys_id>^stage!=cancelled&sysparm_fields=sla,stage,has_breached,planned_end_time,percentage,business_percentage&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 5: Search Knowledge Base for Solutions

Find relevant KB articles to reference or include in the email response.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  query: workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]^ORtextLIKE[key_terms]
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  limit: 5
```

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  query: workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]^ORtextLIKE[key_terms]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,text,kb_category,author,sys_updated_on,rating
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/kb_knowledge?sysparm_query=workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE<key_terms>&sysparm_fields=number,short_description,text,kb_category,rating&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 6: Retrieve Work Notes for Internal Context

Pull internal work notes so the email response reflects the latest internal analysis.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=<case_sys_id>^element=work_notes^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 10
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_journal_field?sysparm_query=element_id=<case_sys_id>^element=work_notes^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by&sysparm_limit=10
```

### Step 7: Generate Email Response Recommendations

Assemble the gathered information into structured email drafts. Provide multiple variants based on the case state.

```
=== EMAIL RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS ===
Case: [number] | Customer: [first_name] [last_name] | Tier: [tier]
Category: [category] / [subcategory] | State: [state]

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Natural language search for KB articles matching the customer issue |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for emails, case history, SLA status |
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve a single case or contact record by sys_id |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case` | GET | Query case details |
| `/api/now/table/sys_email` | GET | Retrieve email communication history |
| `/api/now/table/kb_knowledge` | GET | Search knowledge base articles |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Pull work notes for internal context |
| `/api/now/table/customer_account` | GET | Account tier and details |
| `/api/now/table/customer_contact` | GET | Contact name, email, preferences |
| `/api/now/table/sn_customerservice_sla` | GET | SLA status and breach info |

## Best Practices

- **Maintain thread continuity:** Always use "Re:" prefix and reference the case number in the subject line to keep email threading intact
- **Match formality to tier:** Gold/Platinum tier customers warrant more formal, personalized language; standard tiers can be professional but concise
- **Acknowledge delays:** If SLA is at risk or breached, proactively acknowledge the delay and apologize before providing the update
- **Include self-service links:** Reference KB articles and portal links so customers can find answers independently in the future
- **Avoid internal details:** Never expose internal work notes, assignment changes, or system details in customer-facing emails
- **Use clear next steps:** Every email should end with a clear indication of what happens next and when
- **Check previous emails:** Always review the email thread to avoid repeating questions or information already provided
- **Proofread for tone:** Ensure the response reads as empathetic and helpful, especially for frustrated customers or escalated cases
- **Consider timezone:** Schedule email sends during the customer's business hours when possible

## Troubleshooting

### "No email history found"

**Cause:** Emails may be stored under a different target record or the case was created through a non-email channel
**Solution:** Try querying with `target_table=sn_customerservice_case^instance=<case_sys_id>`. Also check if the original email created a separate record using `sysparm_query=subject_LIKE[case_number]`.

### "Customer contact email is missing"

**Cause:** The contact record may not have an email address populated
**Solution:** Check the `csm_consumer` record for email. Also check `sys_user` if the contact is an internal user. Fall back to the `opened_by` email if no contact email is available.

### "SLA data not available"

**Cause:** SLA definitions may not be configured for this case type or category
**Solution:** Check if SLA exists by querying `contract_sla` table for the case's assignment group and priority. If no SLA is defined, omit SLA references from the email and use general timeframes.

### "KB articles not relevant"

**Cause:** Search terms may be too specific or KB may not cover this topic
**Solution:** Broaden search terms progressively: start with the exact short_description, then try individual keywords, then try the category name alone. Check multiple knowledge bases if your organization uses separate bases per product.
