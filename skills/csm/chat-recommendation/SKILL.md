# Chat Recommendation

## Overview

This skill generates context-aware chat response recommendations for Customer Service Management (CSM) agents during live chat interactions. It helps you:

- Analyze the current case context including category, product, and customer tier
- Search the knowledge base for relevant articles matching the customer's issue
- Review similar resolved cases for proven response patterns and solutions
- Retrieve customer history to personalize recommendations
- Generate professional, empathetic, and accurate chat replies for agent use

**When to use:** When a CSM agent is handling a live chat or messaging interaction and needs quick, contextually appropriate response suggestions. Also useful for training new agents or building response templates.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `sn_customerservice_agent`, `sn_customerservice_manager`, or `csm_admin`
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_customerservice_case`, `interaction`, `kb_knowledge`, `sys_journal_field`, `customer_account`, and `csm_consumer` tables
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with your organization's CSM knowledge base structure and chat interaction workflows
- **Configuration:** Chat channel should be enabled in CSM workspace; knowledge bases should be populated with current articles

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve Current Case and Interaction Context

Fetch the active case details and the current chat interaction to understand what the customer is asking about.

**Using MCP (Claude Code/Desktop):**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  sys_id: [case_sys_id]
  fields: number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,contact,account,consumer,product,asset,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,contact_type,resolution_code,escalation
```

Retrieve the active chat interaction:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: interaction
  query: parent=<case_sys_id>^channel=chat^state=2^ORDERBYDESCopened_at
  fields: sys_id,number,channel,state,opened_at,short_description,assigned_to,direction
  limit: 1
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case/{case_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,contact,account,consumer,product,assigned_to,assignment_group,opened_at,contact_type,escalation&sysparm_display_value=true

GET /api/now/table/interaction?sysparm_query=parent=<case_sys_id>^channel=chat^state=2^ORDERBYDESCopened_at&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,channel,state,opened_at,short_description,assigned_to&sysparm_limit=1&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Customer History and Account Context

Understand the customer's history, tier, and previous interactions to personalize responses.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: customer_account
  query: sys_id=[account_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,name,number,customer_tier,industry,notes,phone,account_code
  limit: 1
```

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: csm_consumer
  query: sys_id=[consumer_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,name,email,phone,title,preferred_language,timezone
  limit: 1
```

Retrieve the customer's recent case history:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: consumer=[consumer_sys_id]^sys_id!=<current_case_sys_id>^ORDERBYDESCopened_at
  fields: number,short_description,state,category,resolution_code,resolution_notes,opened_at,closed_at
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/customer_account/{account_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=name,number,customer_tier,industry,notes&sysparm_display_value=true

GET /api/now/table/csm_consumer/{consumer_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=name,email,phone,preferred_language,timezone&sysparm_display_value=true

GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case?sysparm_query=consumer=<consumer_sys_id>^sys_id!=<current_case_sys_id>^ORDERBYDESCopened_at&sysparm_fields=number,short_description,state,category,resolution_code,resolution_notes&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Search Knowledge Base for Relevant Articles

Query the knowledge base using case keywords, category, and product to find applicable solutions.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  query: workflow_state=published^kb_category.label=[case_category]^textLIKE[key_terms]^ORshort_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  limit: 5
```

For structured queries:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: kb_knowledge
  query: workflow_state=published^kb_category.label=[case_category]^textLIKE[key_terms]^ORshort_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,text,kb_category,author,sys_updated_on,rating
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/kb_knowledge?sysparm_query=workflow_state=published^short_descriptionLIKE<key_terms>^ORtextLIKE<key_terms>&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,text,kb_category,rating&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 4: Find Similar Resolved Cases

Search for previously resolved cases with similar characteristics for proven solutions.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: category=[case_category]^subcategory=[case_subcategory]^stateIN6,7^resolution_codeISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at
  fields: number,short_description,resolution_code,resolution_notes,category,subcategory,product,closed_at
  limit: 5
```

For broader matching with an encoded query:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  query: category=<category>^subcategory=<subcategory>^stateIN6,7^resolution_codeISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case?sysparm_query=category=<category>^subcategory=<subcategory>^stateIN6,7^resolution_codeISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at&sysparm_fields=number,short_description,resolution_code,resolution_notes,product&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Recent Chat Messages

Pull the recent conversation messages to understand the current flow and avoid repeating questions.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=<case_sys_id>^element=comments^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on
  fields: value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 20
```

Also check for any live chat transcript entries:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: interaction_entry
  query: interaction=<interaction_sys_id>^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,message,type,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 50
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_journal_field?sysparm_query=element_id=<case_sys_id>^element=comments^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by&sysparm_limit=20

GET /api/now/table/interaction_entry?sysparm_query=interaction=<interaction_sys_id>^ORDERBYsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=message,type,sys_created_on,sys_created_by&sysparm_limit=50
```

### Step 6: Generate Chat Response Recommendations

Based on all gathered context, assemble recommended responses. Structure recommendations by scenario:

```
=== CHAT RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS ===
Case: [number] | Customer: [name] | Tier: [tier]
Category: [category] / [subcategory] | Product: [product]

CUSTOMER CONTEXT:
- Account Tier: [tier] (adjust formality accordingly)
- Previous Cases: [count] ([resolved_count] resolved)
- Preferred Language: [language]
- Known Issue: [yes/no - if matches known KB article]

RECOMMENDED GREETING:
"Hello [contact_name], thank you for reaching out. I can see you're
contacting us about [short_description]. I'm here to help you with that."

RECOMMENDED RESPONSE (Based on KB Article [kb_number]):
"I understand you're experiencing [issue_description]. Based on our
documentation, here are the steps to resolve this:
1. [step_1 from KB article]
2. [step_2 from KB article]
3. [step_3 from KB article]
Would you like me to walk you through these steps?"

ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE (Based on Similar Case [case_number]):
"I've seen similar cases where [resolution_summary]. Let me check
if the same solution applies to your situation. Could you confirm
[clarifying_question]?"

ESCALATION RESPONSE (if needed):
"I want to make sure this gets the attention it deserves. I'm going
to bring in a specialist from our [team_name] team who can provide
more detailed assistance. Please hold for just a moment."

CLOSING RESPONSE:
"Is there anything else I can help you with today? If this issue
comes up again, you can reference KB article [kb_number] in our
support portal for quick self-service."
```

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Natural language search for KB articles and similar cases |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for case history, interactions, KB articles |
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve a single case or interaction record by sys_id |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case` | GET | Query current and historical cases |
| `/api/now/table/interaction` | GET | Retrieve chat interaction details |
| `/api/now/table/interaction_entry` | GET | Pull chat transcript messages |
| `/api/now/table/kb_knowledge` | GET | Search knowledge base articles |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Retrieve comments and work notes |
| `/api/now/table/customer_account` | GET | Customer account and tier info |
| `/api/now/table/csm_consumer` | GET | Consumer profile and preferences |

## Best Practices

- **Match tone to customer tier:** Premium/Gold tier customers should receive more personalized and formal responses; adjust language accordingly
- **Reference specific KB articles:** Always include KB article numbers so agents can share links with customers
- **Avoid jargon:** Recommendations should use customer-friendly language; reserve technical details for internal work notes
- **Acknowledge repeat contacts:** If the customer has prior cases on the same topic, acknowledge the history and apologize for recurring issues
- **Suggest self-service options:** When appropriate, point customers to portal resources for future similar issues
- **Keep messages concise:** Chat responses should be 2-4 sentences maximum; break longer instructions into multiple messages
- **Provide multiple options:** Offer 2-3 response variations so agents can choose the most appropriate one
- **Use customer's name:** Always personalize greetings and responses with the customer's first name

## Troubleshooting

### "No KB articles found"

**Cause:** Knowledge base may not have articles matching the case category or product
**Solution:** Broaden the encoded `SN-Query-Table` search using only key terms from the short description. Also check if articles exist in a different knowledge base using `kb_knowledge_baseLIKE[name]`.

### "No similar resolved cases found"

**Cause:** Category or subcategory may not have enough resolved case history
**Solution:** Broaden the query by removing subcategory filter. Try matching on product alone, or use `short_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]` instead of exact category match.

### "Chat transcript is empty"

**Cause:** Interaction entry records may use a different table or the chat has not started
**Solution:** Check `live_message` table as an alternative: `sysparm_query=group=<interaction_sys_id>^ORDERBYsys_created_on`. Also verify the interaction state is active (state=2).

### "Customer history not loading"

**Cause:** Consumer sys_id may differ from the contact sys_id
**Solution:** First query `customer_contact` to get the consumer reference, then use that to query case history. The `consumer` field on the case links to `csm_consumer`, while `contact` links to `customer_contact`.
