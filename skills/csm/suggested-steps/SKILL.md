# Suggested Resolution Steps for CSM Cases

## Overview

This skill generates AI-powered resolution step recommendations for active customer service cases. By analyzing the case's product, issue category, customer context, and historical resolution patterns from similar cases, it produces a prioritized list of troubleshooting and resolution steps for agents. It covers:

- Analyzing the active case to extract issue classification, product, and symptoms
- Querying resolved cases with matching category, product, and keywords for resolution patterns
- Ranking resolution approaches by success rate and average resolution time
- Generating step-by-step resolution guidance tailored to the specific case context
- Incorporating relevant knowledge articles as reference material within steps
- Suggesting escalation paths when standard resolution steps are unlikely to resolve the issue

**When to use:** When an agent opens a new or in-progress case and needs guidance on resolution approach, when a junior agent encounters an unfamiliar issue type, or when automating resolution suggestions in Agent Workspace.

**Value proposition:** Reduces mean time to resolution by surfacing proven resolution approaches from historical data. Ensures consistent troubleshooting methodology across the support team regardless of agent experience level.

## Prerequisites

- **Plugins:** Customer Service Management (`com.sn_customerservice`) must be active
- **Roles:** `sn_customerservice_agent`, `sn_customerservice_manager`, or `csm_admin`
- **Access:** Read access to `sn_customerservice_case`, `interaction`, `csm_consumer`, `kb_knowledge`, and `sys_journal_field` tables
- **Data:** A sufficient volume of resolved cases (recommended 50+ per category) to generate meaningful suggestions
- **Knowledge:** Understanding of case categorization taxonomy and product catalog in your instance

## Procedure

### Step 1: Retrieve the Active Case Context

Fetch the full case details to understand the issue being reported.

**Using MCP (Claude Code/Desktop):**
```
Tool: SN-Get-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  sys_id: [case_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,product,asset,contact_type,consumer,account,cause,escalation,opened_at
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case/{case_sys_id}?sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,description,state,priority,category,subcategory,product,asset,contact_type,consumer,account,cause,escalation,opened_at&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Case Communications for Symptom Analysis

Pull customer-reported symptoms from comments and interactions.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=[case_sys_id]^elementINcomments,work_notes^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: sys_id,element,value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 15
```

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: interaction
  query: parent=[case_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCopened_at
  fields: sys_id,channel,short_description,opened_at,state
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_journal_field?sysparm_query=element_id=[case_sys_id]^elementINcomments,work_notes^ORDERBYsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=sys_id,element,value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by&sysparm_limit=15

GET /api/now/table/interaction?sysparm_query=parent=[case_sys_id]^ORDERBYDESCopened_at&sysparm_fields=sys_id,channel,short_description,opened_at,state&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Query Historical Resolutions from Similar Cases

Find resolved cases with matching criteria to extract proven resolution patterns.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: category=[case_category]^subcategory=[case_subcategory]^product=[case_product]^state=3^close_notesISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,close_notes,resolution_code,cause,opened_at,closed_at
  limit: 15
```

For broader matches when specific results are insufficient:
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: category=[case_category]^state=3^close_notesISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,close_notes,resolution_code,cause
  limit: 20
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case?sysparm_query=category=[case_category]^subcategory=[case_subcategory]^product=[case_product]^state=3^close_notesISNOTEMPTY^ORDERBYDESCclosed_at&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,close_notes,resolution_code,cause,opened_at,closed_at&sysparm_limit=15&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 4: Extract Work Notes from Top-Matching Historical Cases

Retrieve the resolution work notes from the most relevant historical cases.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sys_journal_field
  query: element_id=[matched_case_sys_id]^element=work_notes^ORDERBYsys_created_on
  fields: value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by
  limit: 10
```

Repeat for the top 3-5 matching cases to build a resolution pattern corpus.

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sys_journal_field?sysparm_query=element_id=[matched_case_sys_id]^element=work_notes^ORDERBYsys_created_on&sysparm_fields=value,sys_created_on,sys_created_by&sysparm_limit=10
```

### Step 5: Search for Relevant Knowledge Articles

Find KB articles that can supplement resolution steps.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Natural-Language-Search
Parameters:
  query: [case_short_description] [case_product]
  table: kb_knowledge
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/kb_knowledge?sysparm_query=short_descriptionLIKE[key_terms]^workflow_state=published^ORDERBYDESCsys_view_count&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,text,sys_view_count,rating&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 6: Analyze Consumer History for Context

Check if the consumer has experienced this issue before or has relevant history.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  query: consumer=[consumer_sys_id]^category=[case_category]^state=3
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,close_notes,resolution_code,closed_at
  limit: 5
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case?sysparm_query=consumer=[consumer_sys_id]^category=[case_category]^state=3&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,close_notes,resolution_code,closed_at&sysparm_limit=5&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 7: Generate and Present Suggested Resolution Steps

Compile the analysis into a structured resolution recommendation.

```
=== SUGGESTED RESOLUTION STEPS ===
Case: CS0012345 | Category: Portal Access | Product: Customer Portal v3.2

CONFIDENCE: High (based on 12 similar resolved cases)
AVG RESOLUTION TIME: 45 minutes

RECOMMENDED STEPS:
Step 1: Verify Account Status [5 min]
  - Check consumer account is active and not locked
  - Verify email address matches SSO identity provider
  - Reference: KB0034521 - Account Verification Procedure

Step 2: Clear Browser Session Data [5 min]
  - Guide customer to clear cache and cookies for portal domain
  - Recommend trying incognito/private browsing mode
  - If phone/chat: Walk through browser settings step by step

Step 3: Test Portal Access [5 min]
  - Have customer attempt login with cleared session
  - If successful, document browser/version for pattern tracking
  - If failed, proceed to Step 4

Step 4: Check SSO Configuration [15 min]
  - Review SSO logs for authentication failures
  - Verify SAML assertion attributes match expected values
  - Check for recent SSO provider configuration changes
  - Reference: KB0034589 - SSO Troubleshooting Guide

Step 5: Escalation Path [if Steps 1-4 fail]
  - Escalate to Identity & Access Management team
  - Include: SSO logs, browser details, error screenshots
  - SLA Note: P2 cases require resolution within 8 business hours

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (from historical cases):
- 30% of similar cases resolved by cache clear alone (Step 2)
- 25% required SSO config fix (Step 4)
- 20% were account lockout issues (Step 1)
- 15% required browser update/change
- 10% escalated to engineering

PREVIOUSLY TRIED (this customer):
- CS0011234 (Jan 15): Same issue resolved by clearing cookies
  NOTE: Recurring issue may indicate deeper SSO integration problem
```

### Step 8: Add Suggested Steps to Case Work Notes

Post the generated steps to the case as a work note for agent reference.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Update-Record
Parameters:
  table_name: sn_customerservice_case
  sys_id: [case_sys_id]
  fields:
    work_notes: "[AI Suggested Steps] Based on 12 similar resolved cases:\n1. Verify account status (check lockout, email match)\n2. Clear browser session data\n3. Test portal access\n4. Check SSO configuration if persists\n5. Escalate to IAM team if unresolved\nRef: KB0034521, KB0034589\nConfidence: High | Avg resolution: 45 min"
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
PATCH /api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case/{case_sys_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "work_notes": "[AI Suggested Steps] Based on 12 similar resolved cases:\n1. Verify account status\n2. Clear browser session data\n3. Test portal access\n4. Check SSO configuration\n5. Escalate to IAM if unresolved"
}
```

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Semantic search for similar cases and relevant KB articles |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Structured queries for historical cases, work notes, and interactions |
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve the active case details by sys_id |
| `SN-Update-Record` | Post suggested steps as work notes on the case |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/sn_customerservice_case` | GET/PATCH | Query cases and update with suggestions |
| `/api/now/table/interaction` | GET | Retrieve case interactions for context |
| `/api/now/table/csm_consumer` | GET | Consumer history and profile |
| `/api/now/table/kb_knowledge` | GET | Knowledge article search |
| `/api/now/table/sys_journal_field` | GET | Work notes and comments for resolution details |

## Best Practices

- **Rank by success rate:** Order suggested steps by historical resolution frequency, putting the most commonly successful approach first
- **Include time estimates:** Provide expected duration for each step so agents can plan their approach and manage SLAs
- **Reference KB articles:** Link relevant knowledge articles within each step for agents who need deeper guidance
- **Show confidence level:** Indicate how many similar cases the suggestions are based on so agents can gauge reliability
- **Flag recurring issues:** If the same customer has experienced the issue before, highlight the pattern and suggest preventive measures
- **Respect case priority:** Adjust step ordering and escalation thresholds based on case priority (P1 cases should suggest escalation earlier)
- **Update with outcomes:** Track which suggested steps actually resolved the case to improve future recommendations
- **Avoid over-automation:** Present steps as suggestions, not mandates; agents should apply judgment based on the specific case context

## Troubleshooting

### "No similar cases found"

**Cause:** The case category/product combination is new or rare, or case data is sparse.
**Solution:** Broaden the search by removing product or subcategory filters. Fall back to category-only matching or use `SN-Natural-Language-Search` with the case description for semantic matching.

### "Suggested steps are too generic"

**Cause:** Historical cases have vague or inconsistent close notes.
**Solution:** Weight cases with detailed work notes more heavily. Extract step-by-step details from work notes rather than relying solely on close_notes summaries.

### "Resolution confidence is low"

**Cause:** Fewer than 5 similar resolved cases available, or resolution patterns are inconsistent.
**Solution:** Display the low confidence warning to the agent. Suggest they consult with a senior agent or SME and document the resolution thoroughly for future cases.

### "Steps reference outdated KB articles"

**Cause:** Knowledge articles may have been retired or superseded.
**Solution:** Check `workflow_state=published` and `valid_to` date on KB articles before including them. Flag articles approaching expiration.
