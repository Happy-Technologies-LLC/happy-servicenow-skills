# Planning Summarization

## Overview

This skill provides a structured approach to summarizing planning activities across ServiceNow's Strategic Portfolio Management module. It covers:

- Aggregating demand records by status, priority, and business unit
- Summarizing portfolio investment decisions and funding allocations
- Generating sprint planning summaries with capacity and commitment data
- Creating release planning overviews with feature readiness status
- Producing executive meeting summaries with key metrics and recommendations
- Consolidating program-level status for steering committee reviews

**When to use:** When portfolio managers, program managers, or product owners need concise summaries of planning data for governance meetings, sprint planning, release readiness reviews, or executive briefings in ServiceNow SPM.

## Prerequisites

- **Plugins:** `com.snc.project` (Project Portfolio Management), `com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0` (Agile Development 2.0)
- **Roles:** `demand_manager`, `portfolio_manager`, `project_manager`, `scrum_master`, or `program_manager`
- **Access:** Read access to `dm_demand`, `pm_portfolio`, `pm_program`, `pm_project`, `rm_sprint`, `rm_story`, `rm_release`, `planned_task` tables
- **Knowledge:** Understanding of demand management lifecycle, portfolio governance processes, and agile ceremonies

## Procedure

### Step 1: Summarize Demand Pipeline

Query demand records to understand the intake pipeline and pending decisions.

**Using MCP (Claude Code/Desktop):**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: dm_demand
  query: stateNOT IN-5,4,7^ORDERBYpriority
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,priority,type,business_unit,requested_by,requested_for,estimated_cost,estimated_effort,strategic_alignment,score,due_date,assignment_group
  limit: 50
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/dm_demand?sysparm_query=stateNOT IN-5,4,7^ORDERBYpriority&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,state,priority,type,business_unit,requested_by,estimated_cost,estimated_effort,strategic_alignment,score,due_date,assignment_group&sysparm_limit=50&sysparm_display_value=true
```

Group demands by state for a pipeline overview:

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: dm_demand
  query: state=1
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,priority,type,business_unit,estimated_cost,score
  limit: 30
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/dm_demand?sysparm_query=state=1&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,priority,type,business_unit,estimated_cost,score&sysparm_limit=30&sysparm_display_value=true
```

Demand states reference:
| State Value | Label | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| -5 | Draft | Initial creation, incomplete |
| 1 | New | Submitted, awaiting screening |
| 2 | Screening | Under initial assessment |
| 3 | Qualified | Approved for further analysis |
| 10 | Assessment | Detailed business case review |
| 15 | Approved | Approved for funding/execution |
| 4 | Closed | Completed or rejected |
| 7 | Cancelled | Withdrawn from pipeline |

### Step 2: Assess Portfolio Allocation

Query the portfolio to understand investment distribution and remaining budget.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: pm_portfolio
  query: state=2
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,total_budget,allocated_budget,remaining_budget,portfolio_manager,fiscal_year,strategic_theme
  limit: 10
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/pm_portfolio?sysparm_query=state=2&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,state,total_budget,allocated_budget,remaining_budget,portfolio_manager,fiscal_year,strategic_theme&sysparm_limit=10&sysparm_display_value=true
```

Query projects within the portfolio for allocation breakdown:

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: pm_project
  query: portfolio=[portfolio_sys_id]^stateNOT IN-5,4
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,phase,budget_cost,actual_cost,percent_complete,health,priority,end_date,project_manager
  limit: 30
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/pm_project?sysparm_query=portfolio=[portfolio_sys_id]^stateNOT IN-5,4&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,state,phase,budget_cost,actual_cost,percent_complete,health,priority,end_date,project_manager&sysparm_limit=30&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 3: Generate Sprint Planning Summary

For agile teams, summarize the sprint planning data including capacity and committed stories.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: rm_sprint
  query: release.product.sys_id=[product_sys_id]^state=1
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,start_date,end_date,capacity,story_points,state
  limit: 3
```

Query stories committed to the upcoming sprint:

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: rm_story
  query: sprint=[sprint_sys_id]^ORDERBYpriority
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,story_points,state,priority,epic,assigned_to,acceptance_criteria,blocked
  limit: 50
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/rm_story?sysparm_query=sprint=[sprint_sys_id]^ORDERBYpriority&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,story_points,state,priority,epic,assigned_to,acceptance_criteria,blocked&sysparm_limit=50&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 4: Compile Release Readiness

Query the release and its associated features for readiness assessment.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: rm_release
  query: product.sys_id=[product_sys_id]^state!=3^ORDERBYstart_date
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,start_date,end_date,state,description
  limit: 5
```

Query stories in the release grouped by completion status:

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: rm_story
  query: sprint.release=[release_sys_id]
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,story_points,state,epic,sprint,blocked
  limit: 100
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/rm_story?sysparm_query=sprint.release=[release_sys_id]&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,story_points,state,epic,sprint,blocked&sysparm_limit=100&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 5: Review Program Status

For program-level planning, aggregate across constituent projects.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: pm_project
  query: program=[program_sys_id]^stateNOT IN-5,4
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,phase,health,percent_complete,schedule_variance,budget_cost,actual_cost,end_date,project_manager,risk
  limit: 20
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/pm_project?sysparm_query=program=[program_sys_id]^stateNOT IN-5,4&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,state,phase,health,percent_complete,schedule_variance,budget_cost,actual_cost,end_date,project_manager,risk&sysparm_limit=20&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 6: Review Contract Dependencies

Check active contracts that impact planning timelines or resource availability.

**Using MCP:**
```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: ast_contract
  query: stateNOT IN-5,3,4^end_date>=javascript:gs.nowDateTime()^ORDERBYend_date
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,state,vendor,start_date,end_date,contract_value,renewal_date,contract_type
  limit: 15
```

**Using REST API:**
```bash
GET /api/now/table/ast_contract?sysparm_query=stateNOT IN-5,3,4^end_date>=javascript:gs.nowDateTime()^ORDERBYend_date&sysparm_fields=sys_id,number,short_description,state,vendor,start_date,end_date,contract_value,renewal_date,contract_type&sysparm_limit=15&sysparm_display_value=true
```

### Step 7: Assemble Executive Planning Summary

Compile all data into a structured meeting summary:

```
=== PLANNING MEETING SUMMARY ===

```

## Tool Usage

### MCP Tools Reference

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `SN-Query-Table` | Query demands, projects, sprints, stories, releases, contracts |
| `SN-Get-Record` | Retrieve a single portfolio, program, or project record |
| `SN-Natural-Language-Search` | Natural language search for planning items (e.g., "find approved demands for engineering") |
| `SN-Query-Table` | Retrieve bounded fields; calculate totals, averages, and counts locally |

### REST API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/now/table/dm_demand` | GET | Query demand pipeline and intake records |
| `/api/now/table/pm_portfolio` | GET | Portfolio budget and investment data |
| `/api/now/table/pm_program` | GET | Program-level status aggregation |
| `/api/now/table/pm_project` | GET | Project status and financial data |
| `/api/now/table/rm_sprint` | GET | Sprint planning and capacity data |

| `/api/now/table/planned_task` | GET | Planned task data for schedule analysis |

## Best Practices

- **Prepare Before Meetings:** Generate summaries at least 1 hour before governance meetings to allow review time
- **Include Decision Points:** Every summary should clearly state what decisions are needed from the audience
- **Show Trends:** Compare current metrics against the previous period to highlight improvements or deterioration
- **Use Strategic Alignment Scores:** When presenting demands, always include strategic alignment to guide prioritization
- **Separate Facts from Recommendations:** Clearly distinguish data-driven observations from subjective recommendations
- **Limit Scope per Summary:** Focus on one planning context (portfolio, program, sprint, or release) per summary to avoid information overload
- **Track Decisions:** Record meeting outcomes as updates on demand or project records for audit trail
- **Validate Budget Data:** Cross-check portfolio budget figures against finance systems before presenting to executives

## Troubleshooting

### "Demand records not showing expected fields"

**Cause:** Custom demand forms may have different field names or additional fields
**Solution:** Query `sys_dictionary` with `name=dm_demand` to discover the actual field names in your instance. Check for custom fields prefixed with `u_`.

### "Portfolio budget does not match project sum"

**Cause:** Not all projects may be linked to the portfolio, or some projects span multiple portfolios
**Solution:** Verify each project's `portfolio` field. Also check for demands approved but not yet converted to projects.

### "Sprint capacity shows zero"

**Cause:** Capacity may need to be manually set or calculated from team member availability
**Solution:** Check the sprint record's `capacity` field. If blank, calculate from team availability: number of team members multiplied by average velocity per person.

### "Release stories count is incomplete"

**Cause:** Stories may be linked to sprints in the release but not directly to the release itself
**Solution:** Query stories via `sprint.release=[release_sys_id]` rather than a direct release field on the story.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Portfolio Review Summary

**Scenario:** Prepare a summary for the Q2 portfolio governance board meeting.

```
Tool: SN-Query-Table
Parameters:
  table_name: pm_portfolio
  query: short_descriptionLIKEFY2026^state=2
  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,total_budget,allocated_budget,remaining_budget,portfolio_manager
  limit: 5
```

**Output:**
```
Q2 2026 PORTFOLIO REVIEW
Portfolio: FY2026 Technology Investments

INVESTMENT SUMMARY:
  Total Budget: $12.0M | Allocated: $9.4M | Available: $2.6M
  Projects Active: 14 | Completing This Quarter: 3 | Starting: 2
