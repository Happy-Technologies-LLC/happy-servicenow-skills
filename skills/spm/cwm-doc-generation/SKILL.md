# CWM Documentation Generation

## Overview

This skill covers generating comprehensive Collaborative Work Management (CWM) documentation from ServiceNow project data:

- Creating automated project status reports with milestone progress, budget, and timeline health
- Generating risk summaries with impact assessments and mitigation plans
- Building stakeholder communications tailored to audience (executive, sponsor, team)
- Producing portfolio-level dashboards summarizing multiple project health indicators
- Extracting project insights from task data, resource allocation, and activity history
- Generating meeting-ready project update presentations

**When to use:** When preparing weekly/monthly status reports, communicating project health to stakeholders, summarizing portfolio status for leadership, or generating risk and issue digests.

## Prerequisites

- **Roles:** `project_manager`, `program_manager`, `portfolio_manager`, or `admin`
- **Plugins:** `com.snc.project_management` (Project Portfolio Management) or CWM workspace
- **Access:** Read access to `pm_project`, `pm_project_task`, `planned_task`, `risk`, `issue`, `pm_resource_plan` tables
- **Data:** Active projects with populated tasks, milestones, and status data
- **Related Skills:** `spm/cwm-tasks-generation` for task breakdown, `spm/project-insights` for analytics

FORECAST: [Project on track for [date] completion / Recommend [action] to recover schedule]
```

### Step 7: Generate Stakeholder Communication

Tailor communications for different audiences.

**Sponsor Update:**
```
Subject: [Project Name] - Status Update [Date]

Dear [Sponsor Name],

[One paragraph summary of project health and progress]

Key highlights this period:
- [Highlight 1]
- [Highlight 2]

Items requiring your attention:
- [Decision or escalation needed]

Next milestone: [name] targeted for [date].

Full status report attached for reference.
```

**Team Update:**
```
Subject: [Project Name] - Weekly Update [Date]

  fields: sys_id,number,short_description,health,percent_complete,schedule_health,cost_health,budget_cost,actual_cost,planned_end_date,project_manager
  limit: 50
```

```
=== PORTFOLIO STATUS SUMMARY ===
Portfolio: [name]

Active Projects: [count]

HEALTH OVERVIEW:
Green: [count] | Yellow: [count] | Red: [count]

| Project | Health | Progress | Schedule | Budget | PM |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-----|
| [name] | [G/Y/R] | [%] | [on-track/late] | [$actual/$budget] | [name] |

PORTFOLIO BUDGET:
Total Budget: $[sum]
Total Spend: $[sum]
Overall Variance: [%]

ATTENTION REQUIRED:
- [Project X]: [issue requiring attention]
- [Project Y]: [risk or escalation]
```

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| SN-Query-Table | Retrieve project tasks, risks, issues, resources | Data collection for reports |
| SN-Get-Record | Get detailed project record | Core project data retrieval |
| SN-Natural-Language-Search | Find projects by natural language description | Exploratory project lookup |
| SN-Create-Record | Create status report records in ServiceNow | Persisting generated reports |

## Best Practices

1. **Automate report generation** on a weekly cadence to maintain consistency
2. **Lead with health indicators** -- stakeholders want to know status at a glance
3. **Tailor depth to audience** -- executives need summaries, teams need details
4. **Highlight variances** -- focus on deviations from plan rather than restating the plan
5. **Include actionable items** -- every report should have clear next steps or decisions needed
6. **Use consistent formatting** -- standardize report templates across the portfolio
7. **Track report history** -- maintain status report records for trend analysis
8. **Validate data freshness** -- ensure task and milestone data is current before generating reports
9. **Flag stale projects** -- highlight projects with no activity in the past 2 weeks
10. **Include forecast** -- always project forward, not just report backward

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Health indicators blank | Health calculation not configured or not run | Trigger project health recalculation; check health rule configuration |
| Milestone dates missing | Milestones not flagged on tasks | Verify `milestone=true` is set on key project tasks |
| Budget data shows zero | Budget fields not populated on project record | Check `budget_cost` and `actual_cost` fields; may use separate financial tables |
| Resource data incomplete | Resource plans not created or not linked | Verify `pm_resource_plan` records exist for the project |
| Risk scores not calculated | Risk assessment not completed | Ensure probability and impact fields are populated on risk records |
| Portfolio query returns no projects | Projects not linked to portfolio | Check `portfolio` reference field on project records |
