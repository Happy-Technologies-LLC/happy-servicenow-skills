## Happy Platform MCP v5.1 contract

The bundled contract contains exactly 55 live MCP tools. Docs-only startup
exposes exactly six docs-only tools: the five documentation tools plus
`SN-Register-Instance`.

Use only tool names present in the bundled versioned contracts under
`contracts/`. Prefer live MCP tools for ServiceNow operations. Use background
script execution only when the live MCP contract cannot express the operation.

## Installation

```bash
# npm package and CLI
npm install happy-platform-skills

# Agent skill discovery from GitHub
npx skills add Happy-Technologies-LLC/happy-platform-skills --all --full-depth
```

## Package API

```javascript

const registry = new SkillRegistry();
await registry.discover();

const skill = await SkillLoader.load('itsm/incident-triage');
