## How to Submit a New Skill

### 1. Choose the Right Category

Place your skill in the appropriate category directory under `skills/`:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `itsm/` | Incident, problem, change, request workflows |
| `csm/` | Customer service management |
| `hrsd/` | HR service delivery |
| `development/` | Scripts, APIs, testing, code patterns |
| `admin/` | System administration, deployment, configuration |
| `catalog/` | Service catalog items and fulfillment |
| `cmdb/` | Configuration management, CI operations |
| `security/` | Access control, compliance, data classification |
| `secops/` | Security operations center workflows |
| `grc/` | Governance, risk, and compliance |
| `genai/` | AI/ML features, automation generation |
| `knowledge/` | Knowledge management and articles |
| `spm/` | Strategic portfolio management |
| `itom/` | IT operations management |
| `reporting/` | Reports, dashboards, analytics |
| `procurement/` | Procurement and finance |
| `legal/` | Legal and contract management |
| `fsm/` | Field service management |
| `sam/` | Software asset management |

If your skill doesn't fit an existing category, propose a new one in your PR description.

### 2. Copy the Template

```bash
mkdir -p skills/<category>/my-skill
cp templates/skill-template/TEMPLATE.md skills/<category>/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### 3. Write Your Skill

Follow the template structure. Every skill must include:

- **Required frontmatter** with name, version, and description
- **Overview** — What the skill does and when to use it
- **Prerequisites** — Required roles, permissions, or setup
- **Procedure** — Step-by-step instructions with decision points

Use the catalog-standard recommended frontmatter fields: author, tags, platforms,
tools, complexity, and estimated_time. When present, these fields must satisfy
the shapes and values in [the skill specification](docs/SKILL_SPEC.md).

Add these sections when they improve the skill:

- **Best Practices** — Industry-standard recommendations
- **Tool Usage** — MCP, REST, and native tool alternatives
- **Troubleshooting** — Common issues and solutions

### 4. Validate

```bash
npm run validate
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b skill/category-name`
- Commit your changes
- Push and open a PR against `main`
- Include your CLA signature in the PR description

## Naming Conventions

### Skill Names

Skill names must use **generic platform terminology**. Do not include vendor names, trademarked product names, or proprietary feature names in skill file names or directory names.

**Good:**
- `incident-triage`
- `change-risk-explanation`
- `contract-analysis`
- `flow-generation`
- `ai-search-rag`

**Bad:**
- `servicenow-incident-triage` (vendor name in skill name)
- `now-assist-setup` (proprietary product name as skill name)
- `virtual-agent-config` (ambiguous with trademarked product — use descriptive alternative)

### Category Directories

Category names use industry-standard abbreviations:
- `itsm`, `csm`, `hrsd`, `cmdb`, `grc`, `secops`, `itom`, `spm`, `fsm`, `sam`
- Or descriptive terms: `development`, `admin`, `catalog`, `security`, `reporting`, `knowledge`, `legal`, `procurement`, `document`

### Directory and File Naming

- Use a lowercase kebab-case directory containing `SKILL.md`: `my-skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Use either the directory slug or `<category>-<directory-slug>` for frontmatter
  `name`, and ensure the resulting name is globally unique in the catalog
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Focus on what the skill *does*, not which platform it targets

## Trademark Guidelines

When writing skill content:

1. **Never use trademarked names in file or directory names.** Vendor names belong only in descriptive documentation text.
2. **Use ® on first reference** to registered trademarks within a document (e.g., "ServiceNow®").
3. **Use generic terms** where possible: "platform," "instance," "enterprise service management."
4. **Do not use proprietary product names as if they are generic terms.** For example, refer to "virtual agent capabilities" generically rather than capitalizing as a branded feature.
5. **Never copy vendor documentation, sample code, or store app code.** All content must be original.

## Quality Standards

### Content

- All procedures must be tested and verified on a current platform release
- Include both MCP tool and REST API alternatives for platform-agnostic compatibility
- Decision points must have clear criteria and outcomes
- Troubleshooting sections must address real-world issues

### Code

- All script examples must be original work
- Scripts must include error handling
- Follow platform scripting best practices (e.g., use `.changes()` in business rules)
- No hardcoded credentials, instance URLs, or sensitive data

### Style

- Write in clear, imperative language ("Query the table" not "You should query the table")
- Use consistent Markdown formatting
- Keep lines under 120 characters where practical
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers

## Review Process

1. **Automated validation** — `npm run validate` must pass
2. **Naming review** — Skill names checked for trademark compliance
3. **Content review** — Procedure accuracy, completeness, and originality
4. **Maintainer approval** — At least one maintainer must approve

PRs that fail CLA verification or contain trademarked terms in file/directory names will not be merged.
